# Introduction-to-Theoretical-Computer-Science

The course introduces formal models of automata and grammars used for description, definition, software and hardware implementation, as well as verification of correctness of execution of computer and communication processes, protocols, and systems. Basic properties of computing processes and systems, such as determinism, decidability, computability, complexity, and tractability, are explained. Basics of automata theory, formal grammars, and languages are given. Chomsky hierarchy of languages is presented: regular languages, context-free languages, context-sensitive languages, recursive languages, and recursively-enumerable languages. Complexity classes and hierarchy of complexity classes are defined: complete and hard problems, polynomial classes P and NP, and reduction method.
